Strategy: If the maximum coordinate of one line is smaller than the minimum coordinate of the other line, 
it means they do not have overlap. The function works for positive and negative values, and the order by
which the coordinate are entered does not matter, for example line1 could be: (5,1) instead of (1,5)
