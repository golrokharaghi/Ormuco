Question B

The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one
is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. 
Please provide all test cases you could think of.

Strategy: 
Two version strings may have a delimiter other than '.', for example 1-1, so at first the function handles these cases,
and replace any other possible delimiter with '.' .

Then split the two strings by '.' to be able to compare their elements.

If two strings do not have the same length, like: 1.2 and 1.2.2, insert zero to the shortest string such that 
they have the same length.

Compare two strings element by element, the minute an element of the first version is greater or less than the 
corresponding element in the other version, it means the first version is greater or less than the other version,
else two versions are equal.

The function also works if the versions are indicated by alphabet insted of numbers like: a.b and a.b.c
